            <p> Hi, My name is Anindith Reddy Bujala. From the past 7 years I have been studying/working on Computer Science and Software application development. I was a Computer Science Undergrad from Vignan Institute back in Hyderabad, India. In my Undergrad I have studied on various fields of computer sciences. Starting from basic programming Languages, studying on data structures, scripting languages, information security, testing, databases, product development. My Under graduation gave me a strong exposure about computer sciences. Among the various domains, My interest was inclined towards web. Complimenting the Interest, I have done some certifications on web development, Worked on basic web development technologies HTML, CSS, JavaScript and did my undergrad project on web development. Later on, In order to pursue higher academic education, I came to US and studied MS IT in university of Cincinnati. In my masters, I was involved in Research based Learning. Though I did not do my thesis, my core subjects were aligned around research, I was studying research publications and respectively writing my insights on them. This learning gave me a trait of thinking out-of-box, gave me new ways to analyse into how things work/problem solving. Along with my Graduate Studies I have improved web development skills. Also, I have learned new frameworks and to improve my learning I have done some projects that gave me more practical experience on the technologies. With the technologies I know and skills I gathered in my 7 years of learning I am confident enough that I can fulfil most of the requirements of the current trend in web development.</p>
