This website represents me. I have developed this site using all my knowledge, done only by myself. Implemented using Django,React,HTML,CSS,Bootstrap,javascript.

Front end:
React with jsx implemented for rendering the website design. I used Bootstrap to make page responsive and mobile friendly. I used my custom CSS to meet my design requirements. Various bootstrap components and fetures are implemented in the desing of this website. 

Backend:
I used Django to create API for my website. My front end gets projects data from the Django API, This data can even be implemented at the front end by hard coding it in the script but I choose to get it from django to make this project a full stack and to present and improve my skills.
I used Django models to model the project data, and created end point by parsing model data to json format.

Axios was used to connect the front end with End point of API, using javascript the json data is parsed and mapped into the bootdtrap components.
